ðŸŽ‰ #Day01 of #100MiniProjects: Expanding Cards UI Component ðŸŽ‰
Kicking off my #100MiniProjects challenge with an Expanding Cards UI component built using just HTML and CSS! ðŸš€
ðŸ”¹ What It Does:
â€¢	Interactive Experience: Click on a card to see it expand and reveal more content. Ideal for portfolios, service showcases, and more!
â€¢	Responsive Layout: The design adapts perfectly to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
â€¢	Minimal and Efficient: Created with pure HTML and CSS, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into any web project.
